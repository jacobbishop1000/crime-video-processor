# Client Information
- Focus
    Helping police fight crime
    Law enforcement looks through files takes a huge list off their shoulders (i.e. 210 ten phone calls, 70 hours a lot of time)
    New area, learning together as we go
- Main product is Crime Miner
    Helps look through audio to find what you need
- What we're doing: Crime Video Processor
    Helps look through video, with code we will be able to find certain items quickly instead of using man-hours just sitting and watching
- Business Requirements for Crime Video Processor
    Problem we solve: “If I’m looking for a red truck and there’s 20 hours of footage, how am I going to find that red truck without watching through 20 hours of footage?”
    Extract as much meta data per frame as possible
    Use existing tech stack
- Tech Stack
    Ionic Angular Typescript frontend
    Node and Postgres backend
    AWS ML products
    Blaine suggests we look into Amazon Recognition Video
- Next steps
    1. Play around
        Work through sample code, sample data, documentation
        Cloud watch logs
        Play around with the free trial
        “You don’t know what you don’t know”
        Divide up exploration tasks
        "Build it up, break it down, have fun with it!"
    2. Get some more requirements from Cornelius
        Possibly get a demo of the Crime Miner tool
        Get some sample data once we've worked through AWS sample data
