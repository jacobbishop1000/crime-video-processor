    - New area, learning together as we go
- Main product is Crime Miner
    - Helps look through audio to find what you need
- What we're doing: Crime Video Processor
    - Helps look through video, with code we will be able to find certain items quickly instead of using man-hours just sitting and watching
- Business Requirements for Crime Video Processor
    - Problem we solve: “If I’m looking for a red truck and there’s 20 hours of footage, how am I going to find that red truck - without watching through 20 hours of footage?”
    - Extract as much meta data per frame as possible
    - Use existing tech stack

    - Node and Postgres backend
    - AWS ML products

- Next steps
    1. Play around
        - Work through sample code, sample data, documentation
        - Cloud watch logs
        - Play around with the free trial
        - “You don’t know what you don’t know”
        - Divide up exploration tasks
        - "Build it up, break it down, have fun with it!"
    2. Get some more requirements from Cornelius
        - Possibly get a demo of the Crime Miner tool
        - Get some sample data once we've worked through AWS sample data
