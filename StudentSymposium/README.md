We also presented to Prof. Xin Sun and Prof. Lan Lin. We also met Kevin, who we didn't get a picture with, and a few others where we didn't get their name or a picture.

# One paragraph about the Symposium from each member
### Jacob ###
- I thought the Symposium was an overall positive experience. We arrived at around 11:30am and were able to talk to the other members of the CS capstone about their projects and generally socialize, which was nice. It was nice presenting to the judges and to random people interested in what we were doing. We also got some nice feedback about making the software more ADA compliant with different color palette choices. Please, next year, don't make the students take pictures with strangers and get their names. It's awkward at best and rude at worst to ask that of someone when you just met them.

# Team pictures
- Note: Merghani showed up a bit late because he had class, and we didn't get a picture with him in it but he was there!
