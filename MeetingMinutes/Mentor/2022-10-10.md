## Notes

- Drew asked Jacob about Integrating PostgreSQL 
- Drew offered feedback
- Said it should be a “spike” 
- A Spike is a task before it, to figure it out, usually one page. Makes it sure its a clear task so it more clear in the process 
- Talked about the groups attendance and how it could be an issue and Drew said to address it early on and state your expectations to the group.
##### Feedback for Merghani
###### For Architecture Document
- Looks great,All under one API it’ll be good for a group/dotted lines 
- Looks great on how things work well together 
- Web is on their twice, should only be on there once, since there will be use of WebSockets 
###### Domain Model Document
- Its suppose to show, the class diagram, how they all interact with each other
- Mapped the Architecture  with domain, don’t need to be that tightly coupled 
- S3 isn’t part of the domain 
##### Feedback for Eric
###### For Tech-stack Document
- Reason why they chose it 
- Explain it why that whats the reason, how it makes it easier 
- POSTSQL integrate well with AWS and doesnt required maintenance  
- Ergin will challenge, Take it a step further and understanding the trade off, client is more important though
###### For Protype
- Looks great show functionality’s
- Work backwards design search API, knowing what functionality 
- Use this for a better understanding for the domain mapping 
- Having cases and whats included, great start for a mockup 
- Not too much feedback looks good 
##### Feedback for Issac
###### For Use Cases
- Harder to give feedback since dew doesn’t know the domain, Asking the client 
- Clarify actors with Client 
- Starting with the customer, working backwards from that. Can possible build the wrong solution, Ergin has a higher level requirments

###### Questions and comments 
- Follow assignment guidelines 
- Ask him about the Pro-type Video 
- Keep him happy makes thing easier 
- How to present, everyone or just 2? 
- How does design day work?
