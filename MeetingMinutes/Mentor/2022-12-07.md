## Notes

#### Jacob/Eric/Issac/Merghani
- we are about 75 percent complete, shooting for 100
- whats different is we have a connection between Angular and Express 
- We have 1 complete user story
- folllowed our mentors advice 
- postgres is alive and well 
- Angular and Node.js are fully funcutually together
- lots of exprees is done and just connecting with the angular client 
- index.ts can be cleaned up 
- advnace routing not current avialable but will for second itteration
- CRUD operations 
- havent done anything on the security level
- everything is local but still connects to AWS(free tier)
- mostly use Issac credentials 
- everything is temp but our client gave us AWS credentials 

#### Drew / Feedback 
- asked to see some code for the express 
- asked to see database code
- pool.query is it doing any injections? looks like it is 
- look up documentation for query putting value 1,2,3 what is is people concatnate strings 
- security if ports are open since anyone can communicate with it
- risk is people have bots that scan for things/ even with free tier
- not immediatly critical but needs addressed 
- would pull it up with docker container and keep everything local, any inbound traffic would only allow vpc,bpc?
- for adminitration they set up a proxy host and they have a micro ec2, would be add level of security 
- as of now just protected by password, as being an important app security needs 
- once realesed need to test endpoints before giving to client at the end/dont wanna delete everything for cornelius 
- request is using a JSON object
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- One thing is bucket name is hard coded so its unique 
- making the bucket name an enviorment variable 
- now that you touched aws looking at how good/poor it is good 
- thought for how depolying express server to AWS?
- Lambda to see latnecy 
- ecs more expensive if more traffic 
- THnak you for making user rather than giving them root keys 
- for API using the form encode synatx, express is going to convert it 
- anyways but what he has done before is have some sort of listner on the field and be able o perform validations
- and have it store and JSON encode it so its fully incontrol which mean it can be accessed with moblile
- hosting frontend but hosting it thorugh cloudfront, cloud 53
- have it behind api gateways or dynaimc routing to make website is only public access
