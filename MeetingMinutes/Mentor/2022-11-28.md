## Topics Discussed

- AWS deployment options
- Connecting frontend Angular to Node backend

## Things Clarified

- Front end use POST requests that trigger backend
    - Possibly make API endpoints to talk to each other and pass messages
- Connecting frontend Angular to Node backend: use 3-tier architecture
    - Angular frontend
    - Database R3
    - Node Lambda
- Node backend listens for POST requests
- Deploying to Lambda is going to be a cheap way to test this with low traffic
- Isaac clarified some AWS hosting ideas
- Other possible stuff to avoid hot storage: ECS - Docker (but costs more with low traffic)
- Talk with Prof. Ergin to see deployment expectations
    - Fun to figure out but also a lot of work
