## Topics Discussed
- Showed the Demo
- Chuqlab's audio app
- Expectations for users technical knowledge
- Meeting with Cornelius more frequently for next iteration

## Things Clarified
###### Next Features
- Essentially wants us to more or less copy UI from Chuqlab's other app, not to design a new individual aesthetic/workflow
- discussed team's access to view original crime miner app

###### Client User of the Project
- Cornelius used our software via remote control over zoom, on Jacob's machine
- Created a new case, upoaded a file, entered label keywords, run label detection job, and see visualized output of label detections
- They used the software for about 10 minutes
- He said that he liked what we had for this iteration, but was dissapointed that we didn't base our work more off of Chuqlab's audio app
- The workflow did not seem as intuitive to Cornelius as we had hoped. For the 5th iteration, we are planning to meet with him more frequently to get feedback on the UI
- Cornelius was very adamant about wanting the functionality to run label detections on multiple files, so as to make it basically top prioritization for iteration 5
