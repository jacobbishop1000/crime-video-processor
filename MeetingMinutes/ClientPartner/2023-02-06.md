## Topics Discussed
- Showed the Demo
- Let Cornelius taek over the Web Page
- Talked about Itteration 4 features 
- What needs to be improved 

###### Demo 
- Today's Demo:
    Add New Case
    Upload short videos (we have some ones uploaded for convenience)
        Note: this feature is buggy (Longer videos are buggy)
    Start a Label Detection Job
    Look at the results of that job (different labels at different timestamps)
    Visually see the labels in the video

##### Issac
- Explained how the rekognition from AWS was lacking something essentialy we needed before winter break but during break there was a change/update that had exactly what we needed 

###### Cornelius testing Site
- Was a bit confused on where to go at first 
- Having to put the labels as Cap and one at a time is confusing 
- Video can be buggy
- Overall great job 
- Asked if you could upload multiple videos and yes. 
- Loves the path we have taken with the project 

###### Iteration 4 Features 
- Option 1: More features
            This would allow for more Proof-of-Concept, so if the app needs to be fleshed out this is
            a good way to do it
- Option 2: Add user separation for access to their own info
            This would add another layer of complexity
            Next iteration will probably have more features, but still be pretty buggy like this
            iteration
            Think Login screen, each user has its own cases, etc.
## Things Clarified
###### Next Features
- Improve the UI to make it Easier for the user to understand 
- Fix Bugs to improve the creating Labels part and the video output
- Add users to avoid Tech Debt
