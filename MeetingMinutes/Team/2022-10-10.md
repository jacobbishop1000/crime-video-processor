## Notes Taken

- Drew asked Jacob about Integrating PostgreSQL 
- Drew offered feedback
- Said it should be a “spike” 
- Task before it, to figure it out usually one page. 
- Makes it sure its a clear task so it more clear in the process 
- Talked about the groups attendance and how it could be an issue 
- Drew - address it early on and state your expectations then address it 
- Feedback Merghani
- For Architecture
- Looks great ,All under one API it’ll be good for a group/dotted lines 
- How things work together , Web is on their twice, should only be on there  once, since there will be use of WebSockets 
- Domain Model 
- Its suppose to show, the class diagram, how they all interact with each other
- Feedback 
- Mapped the Architecture  with domain, don’t need to be that tightly coupled 
S3 isn’t part of the domain 
- Tech-stack 
- Reason why they chose it 
- Explain it why that whats the reason, how it makes it easier 
- Integrate well with AWS 
- POSTSQL Don’t required maintenance  
- Ergin will challenge
- Take it a step further and understanding the trade off, client is more important
- Looks great show functionality’s
- Work backwards design search API, knowing what functionality 
- Draw the domain mapping from 
- Having cases and whats included, great start for a mockup 
- Not too much feedback  looks good 
- Possibly DM on slack for other feedback 
- Issac joined late
- Use cases 
- Harder to give feedback since dew doesn’t know the domain 
- Asking the client 
- Clarify actors with  Client 
- Starting with the customer, working backwards from that. Can possible build the wrong solution, Ergin has a higher level 
- Follow assignment guidelines 
- Ask him about the Pro-type Video
