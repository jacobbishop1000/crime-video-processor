# Deployment

#### Starting the Angular Client

1. Move into **'{project root}/angular-video-crime-miner'** and run **'npm run site-build'**
2. After a moment of building, the site will be running. Any errors that occur at the time of building will appear in your terminal. Errors that could occur while the angular client is running may only be viewable by right clicking the background of the site, choosing **'Inspect'**, and navigating to the **'Console'**
3. In your browser, go to **'localhost:4200/'**

#### Stopping the Angular Client

 To stop the Angular Client, terminate the process as its running in your terminal

#### Troubleshooting

- make sure that you have run **'npm install'** in both **'{project root}/angular-video-crime-miner'** and **'{project root}/node-video-crime-miner'**
- make sure that you are using *node >= 19*
