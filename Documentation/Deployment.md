#### Starting the Angular Client

1. Move into **'{project root}/angular-video-crime-miner'** and run **'npm run start-site'**
2. After a moment of building, the site will be running. Any errors that occur at the time of building will appear in your terminal. Errors that could occur while the angular client is running may only be viewable by right clicking the background of the site, choosing **'Inspect'**, and navigating to the **'Console'**
3. Open a new terminal and move into **'{project root}/node-video-crime-miner'** and run **'npm run start'**
3. In your browser, go to **'localhost:4200/'**
